# 3-course-DB-project
Advanced Database Management System final project  
We create online book shop

Purpose:
Create worthy rivals for books stores such as meloman and flip.kz. Also create afforadable online bookstore.

Languages and database server:
Java(servlet), mysql. MySQL was our choice because it's easy to connect than oracle or another database servers.

E/R diagram explanation:
This is an ER diagram example that shows the major business entities of an online bookstore as well as their inter-relationships. It consists of typical entities like orders, users, roles, orderdetails, category, products. In this diagram as we see the 'products' table would be the central entity(if we consider right part of diagram and 'products' entity will be a main connection between two tables: orderdetails and category, also both entities will work with 'products' entity)
