E/R diagram explanation
This is an ER diagram example that shows the major business entities of an online bookstore as well as their inter-relationships. It consists of typical entities like orders, users, roles, orderdetails, category, products. In this diagram as we see the 'products' table would be the central entity(if we consider right part of diagram and 'products' entity will be a main connection between two tables: orderdetails and category, also both entities will work with 'products' entity)
